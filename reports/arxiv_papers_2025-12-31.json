    "summary": "We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

    "summary": "Humanoid robots hold great promise for operating in human-centric environments, yet achieving robust whole-body coordination across the head, hands, and legs remains a major challenge. We present a system that combines a modular teleoperation interface with a scalable learning framework to address this problem. Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping. Experiments show that Choice Policy significantly outperforms diffusion policies and standard behavior cloning. Furthermore, our results indicate that hand-eye coordination is critical for success in long-horizon tasks. Our work demonstrates a practical path toward scalable data collection and learning for coordinated humanoid manipulation in unstructured environments.",

    "summary": "Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.\n  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware where they will be deployed -- using code-generating large language models (LLMs). To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.\n  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively.",

    "summary": "This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.",

We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.",

    "summary": "Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.",

    "summary": "Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level \"thought\" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.",

Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.",

We present its axiomatization that is \\emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency fragments of the logic are also individually complete with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. We highlight the expressive power of the logic with some illustrative examples. As a formal context is the basic construct of formal concept analysis (FCA), we generalize three main notions in FCA, i.e., formal concepts, object oriented concepts, and property oriented concepts, to their corresponding $c$-cut concepts in fuzzy formal contexts. Then, we show that our logical language can represent all three of these generalized notions. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of extending our logic to reasoning with multi-relational fuzzy contexts, in which the Boolean combinations of different fuzzy relations are allowed.",

It is therefore of great importance to develop frameworks that allow us to evaluate sequence learning and processing in a domain agnostic fashion, whilst simultaneously providing a link to formal theories of computation and computability. To address this need, we introduce two complementary software tools: SymSeq, designed to rigorously generate and analyze structured symbolic sequences, and SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite of rule-based sequence processing tasks to evaluate the performance of artificial learning systems in cognitively relevant domains. In combination, SymSeqBench offers versatility in investigating sequential structure across diverse knowledge domains, including experimental psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, behavioral analysis, neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Due to its basis in Formal Language Theory (FLT), SymSeqBench provides researchers in multiple domains with a convenient and practical way to apply the concepts of FLT to conceptualize and standardize their experiments, thus advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior through shared computational frameworks and formalisms.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news \"slop.\" Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard.\n  Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a consistent and moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can have adverse effects on large publishers by reducing total website traffic by 23% and real consumer traffic by 14% compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies.\n  Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption.",

In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach.

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).",

    "summary": "Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.",

Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.",

By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.",

However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.",

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.",

Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.",

    "summary": "Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.",

The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules.

    "summary": "We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.",

To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.",

Part I: 1-Categories contains 100 fully formalized statement-level tasks, curated into topic families and three difficulty tiers via an LLM-assisted + human grading process. The best model solves 8.25% of tasks at pass@1 (32.50%/4.17%/0.00% by Easy/Medium/High) and 12.00% at pass@4 (50.00%/4.76%/0.00%). We also evaluate LeanBridge which use LeanExplore to search Mathlib, and observe consistent gains over single-model baselines. LeanCat is intended as a compact, reusable checkpoint for tracking both AI and human progress toward reliable, research-level formalization in Lean.",

    "summary": "Slate recommendation, where users are presented with a ranked list of items simultaneously, is widely adopted in online platforms. Recent advances in generative models have shown promise in slate recommendation by modeling sequences of discrete semantic IDs autoregressively. However, existing autoregressive approaches suffer from semantically entangled item tokenization and inefficient sequential decoding that lacks holistic slate planning. To address these limitations, we propose HiGR, an efficient generative slate recommendation framework that integrates hierarchical planning with listwise preference alignment. First, we propose an auto-encoder utilizing residual quantization and contrastive constraints to tokenize items into semantically structured IDs for controllable generation. Second, HiGR decouples generation into a list-level planning stage for global slate intent, followed by an item-level decoding stage for specific item selection. Third, we introduce a listwise preference alignment objective to directly optimize slate quality using implicit user feedback. Experiments on our large-scale commercial media platform demonstrate that HiGR delivers consistent improvements in both offline evaluations and online deployment. Specifically, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in offline recommendation quality with a 5x inference speedup, while further achieving a 1.22% and 1.73% increase in Average Watch Time and Average Video Views in online A/B tests.",

Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.",

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.",

    "summary": "The challenge of effectively transferring knowledge across multiple tasks is of critical importance and is also present in downstream tasks with foundation models. However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.",

    "summary": "Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

    "summary": "Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a \"numerical-semantic\" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from \"passive detection\" to \"intelligent diagnosis\" for battery safety management.",

We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.",

    "summary": "Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning.

Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.",

We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.",

    "summary": "We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.",

    "summary": "Autonomous mobile robots operating in complex, dynamic environments face the dual challenge of navigating large-scale, structurally diverse spaces with static obstacles while safely interacting with various moving agents. Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal. Overall, these findings confirm that integrating long-term path guidance with semantically-aware local control significantly enhances both the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation in complex human-centric settings.",

    "summary": "Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically generate correct patches for buggy programs. Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.",

    "summary": "Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, sustained vowel phonations. Experiments utilized 15,132 recordings from 1,261 speakers in the Saarbruecken Voice Database, covering vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ at neutral, high, low, and gliding pitches. Mirroring clinical triage workflows, the framework operates in three sequential stages: Stage 1 performs binary screening of pathological versus non-pathological voices by integrating convolutional neural network-derived mel-spectrogram features with 21 interpretable acoustic biomarkers; Stage 2 stratifies voices into Healthy, Functional or Psychogenic, and Structural or Inflammatory groups using a cubic support vector machine; Stage 3 achieves fine-grained classification by incorporating probabilistic outputs from prior stages, improving discrimination of structural and inflammatory disorders relative to functional conditions. The proposed system consistently outperformed flat multi-class classifiers and pre-trained self-supervised models, including META HuBERT and Google HeAR, whose generic objectives are not optimized for sustained clinical phonation. By combining deep spectral representations with interpretable acoustic features, the framework enhances transparency and clinical alignment. These results highlight the potential of quantitative voice biomarkers as scalable, non-invasive tools for early screening, diagnostic triage, and longitudinal monitoring of vocal health.",

    "summary": "Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior.

To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\\textbf{+2.69$\\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.",

    "summary": "Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \\textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \\textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \\textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \\textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\\%) and GAIA (72.8\\%) using open-weight models.

Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management.",

In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.",

However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems.

We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed.",

We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.",

    "summary": "Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).\n  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.\n  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.",
