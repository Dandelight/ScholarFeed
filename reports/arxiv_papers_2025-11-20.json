    "summary": "The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.",

    "summary": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning capabilities marks a significant milestone, unlocking new frontiers in complex problem-solving. However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

    "summary": "Learning multi-fingered robot policies from humans performing daily tasks in natural environments has long been a grand goal in the robotics community. Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

    "summary": "Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.",

    "summary": "We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r},\\ B\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}$ with $r\\ll \\min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.",

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

    "summary": "Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.",

However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.",

The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review.

This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.",

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.",

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers.

    "summary": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.",

To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.",

    "summary": "Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design\". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature.

While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.",

Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.",

Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.",

To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.\n  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.\n  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.",

This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.\n  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.\n  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\\% and 4.27\\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.",

Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.",

We propose a large language model (LLM)-based reward design approach to generate autonomous cyber defense policies in a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven experimental simulation environment. Multiple attack and defense agent personas were crafted, reflecting heterogeneity in agent actions, to generate LLM-guided reward designs where the LLM was first provided with contextual cyber simulation environment information. These reward structures were then utilized within a DRL-driven attack-defense simulation environment to learn an ensemble of cyber defense policies. Our results suggest that LLM-guided reward designs can lead to effective defense strategies against diverse adversarial behaviors.",

Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \\emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \\emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \\textsc{BlockCIR}, a \\emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \\emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit. By aggregating the same signed-co-movement numerators and magnitudes over predefined or data-driven groups, \\textsc{BlockCIR} mitigates double-counting in collinear clusters (e.g., synonyms or duplicated sensors) and yields smoother, more stable rankings when strong dependencies are present. Across diverse text, tabular, signal, and image datasets, ExCIR shows trustworthy agreement with established global baselines and the full model, delivers consistent top-$k$ rankings across settings, and reduces runtime via lightweight evaluation on a subset of rows. Overall, ExCIR provides \\emph{computationally efficient}, \\emph{consistent}, and \\emph{scalable} explainability for real-world deployment.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.",

    "summary": "People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.",

    "summary": "Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making.",

    "summary": "Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.",

To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.",

In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.",

This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective. This study contributes to health information systems by offering a computational solution for integrated physical and mental healthcare and provides design principles for advancing collaborative chronic disease management across the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment phases.",

The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.",

Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.",

    "summary": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.",

These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.",

    "summary": "As LLMs become more common, non-expert users can pose risks, prompting extensive research into jailbreak attacks. However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture \"template-over-safety flip\": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs.",

    "summary": "Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.",

We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in cross-modal understanding, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual inputs despite robust textual safety mechanisms. These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.",

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM.

This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.",

However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams.

    "summary": "Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.",

    "summary": "In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.",

    "summary": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

    "summary": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.",

    "summary": "Metamaterials, known for their ability to manipulate light at subwavelength scales, face significant design challenges due to their complex and sophisticated structures. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.",

Built on Gemini 2, AskDB integrates two key innovations: a dynamic schema-aware prompting mechanism that effectively incorporates database metadata, and a task decomposition framework that enables the agent to plan and execute multi-step actions. These capabilities allow AskDB to autonomously debug derived SQL, retrieve contextual information via real-time web search, and adaptively refine its responses. We evaluate AskDB on a widely used Text-to-SQL benchmark and a curated set of DBA tasks, demonstrating strong performance in both analytical and administrative scenarios.

    "summary": "The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.",

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.",

Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating the value of tunable bias and revealing that both overestimation and underestimation can be exploited differently depending on the environment.",

    "summary": "Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.",

By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Existing workflow engines lack native support for tracking the shapes and dependencies inherent to ragged data, forcing users to manage complex indexing and dependency bookkeeping manually. We present Operon, a Rust-based workflow engine that addresses these challenges through a novel formalism of named dimensions with explicit dependency relations. Operon provides a domain-specific language where users declare pipelines with dimension annotations that are statically verified for correctness, while the runtime system dynamically schedules tasks as data shapes are incrementally discovered during execution. We formalize the mathematical foundation for reasoning about partial shapes and prove that Operon's incremental construction algorithm guarantees deterministic and confluent execution in parallel settings. The system's explicit modeling of partially-known states enables robust persistence and recovery mechanisms, while its per-task multi-queue architecture achieves efficient parallelism across heterogeneous task types. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Operon outperforms an existing workflow engine with 14.94x baseline overhead reduction while maintaining near-linear end-to-end output rates as workloads scale, making it particularly suitable for large-scale data generation pipelines in machine learning applications.",

    "summary": "Conventional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) tend to be inflexible keyword-matchers, and deny gifted candidates a role due to a few minor semantic mismatches. This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable \"gentle polishing process\" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.",

This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.",

    "summary": "Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.",

We present the \"Semantic Glitch,\" a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a \"physical glitch\" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a \"narrative mind\" that complements the \"weak,\" historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling \"plan to execution\" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.",

    "summary": "In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.",

We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.",

While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.",

    "summary": "Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.",

In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of reasoning and generation tasks. However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.",

    "summary": "High-resolution mapping of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a cornerstone of sustainable urbanism but remains critically hindered by the spatial sparsity of ground monitoring networks. While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas. This work provides a robust, low-cost, and all-weather solution for fine-grained environmental management.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.",

Evaluated on the \\texttt{MultiSWE-bench-CPP} benchmark, INFCODE-C++ achieves a resolution rate of 25.58\\%, outperforming the strongest prior agent by 10.85 percentage points and more than doubling the performance of MSWE-agent. Ablation and behavioral studies further demonstrate the critical role of semantic retrieval, structural analysis, and accurate reproduction in C++ issue resolution.

However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command & control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive reconnaissance agents covertly across networks. Notably, we find that our architecture not only improves goal-directed behavior of the system as whole, but also eliminates key host and network artifacts that can be used to detect and prevent command & control behavior altogether. We begin with a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art generative red teaming methods, from fine-tuned specialist models to modular or agentic frameworks, analyzing their automation capabilities against task-specific accuracy. We then detail how our MCP-based C2 can overcome current limitations by enabling asynchronous, parallel operations and real-time intelligence sharing without periodic beaconing. We furthermore explore advanced adversarial capabilities of this architecture, its detection-evasion techniques, and address dual-use ethical implications, proposing defensive measures and controlled evaluation in lab settings. Experimental comparisons with traditional C2 show drastic reductions in manual effort and detection footprint. We conclude with future directions for integrating autonomous exploitation, defensive LLM agents, predictive evasive maneuvers, and multi-agent swarms. The proposed MCP-enabled C2 framework demonstrates a significant step toward realistic, AI-driven red team operations that can simulate advanced persistent threats while informing the development of next-generation defensive systems.",

    "summary": "Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as \"sleeper agents.\" Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.",

Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.",

    "summary": "Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.",

Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain.

To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.",

    "summary": "We propose a self-supervised machine learning (SSML) framework for multi-fidelity learning and extended predictive soil spectroscopy based on latent space embeddings. A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.",

    "summary": "While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.",

Pretrained on more than 1,800 heterogeneous classification datasets, iLTM achieves consistently superior performance across tabular classification and regression tasks, from small datasets to large and high-dimensional tasks. After light fine-tuning, the meta-trained hypernetwork transfers to regression targets, matching or surpassing strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that iLTM outperforms well-tuned GBDTs and leading deep tabular models while requiring less task-specific tuning.
